# FTXcontrol-Shield
An Arduino shield for controlling the Fl채ktWoods RDKR ventilation unit

In this project, I'm monitoring and controlling the ventilation of my house. My ventilation unit is a **Fl채ktWoods RDKR** (which as a rotating heat exchanger, hence FTX) but it should be possible to use at least parts of this project with other systems.

## Features
* Monitor and log temperature and humidity of 
  * outside air (_uteluft_)
  * incoming air (_tilluft_)
  * inside air (_fr책nluft_)
  * outgoing air (_avluft_)
* Monitor the efficiency of the heat (and humidity) exchanger.
* Automatically change ventilation state (low, middle, high) based on temperature and/or humidity values. For example: 
  * Set ventilation to low when outside temperature is higher than inside temperature (Don't have the ventilation heat up the house on hot summer days.)
  * Set venilation to high when oustide temperature is lower than inside temperature and insider temperature is over 25째C. (Cool down the house during the night.)
* Log all values 
  * to either a csv file (using [processing](https://github.com/processing/processing) to read the data from the Arduino serial port) or
  * to an [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) database (using [Petr Pudlak's python script](https://github.com/ppetr/arduino-influxdb) to read the serial port and send the data to the database).
* Display values on an LCD display on the ventilation unit (currently not quite implemented)
* Manually control the ventilation state via a button

## Hardware used
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 3-4 [Sonoff Si7021](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Sonoff_Sensor_Si7021) temperature and humidity sensors
* Various electronic components to build the shield (see schematic). Most importantly:
  * 1 photoresistor for reading the current ventilation state via the LED on the ventilation unit's control board
  * 1 optocoupler to switch the ventilation state on the control board
* 1 LCD display


Please note that this repository does not yet include all the information that it should include. I will remove this line once at least a first version of everything is uploaded.
